# Literature review of CHI trials

'CHI trial lit review.RMD' contains the plotting code for Figure 1, which illustrates the data collected for 
our literature review of controlled human infection trials.

# Identifying correlates of pre-symptomatic transmission

'Fitting statistical model to human infection data.RMD' contains the code for all the cleaning and analysis of 
the data from Ge *et al*., 2023 and Zhou *et al*., 2023. This includes fitting the statistical model we use
to the individual shedding data, running the linear regression analyses on the statistical model parameters and 
pre-symptomatic transmission, and bootstrapping via case resampling the linear regression coefficients
to assess statistical uncertainty.

# Mechanistic within-host model

'Mechanistic model code.RMD' contains the code for the simulations and analyses of the within-host model we 
employ to produce a plausible scenario of pre-symptomatic transmission informed by findings from the 
Ge *et al*., 2023 and Zhou *et al*., 2023 studies.
